# Graph-Processing
A repository created for experiments and projects on social networks, also using the software Gephi for identifying the communities in the social networks 
as part of end term projects of term 3 as part of FODBMS course at FORE School Of Management

As part of end term projects two projects were conducted social network analysis of a network of dolphins, and a social network analysis of Github accounts
using the software Gephi. 
The different communities were identified and interpretations were made at the end of the projects.

**Dolphin data set**- the interpretations were made regarding which dolphins communicated the most with others and what communities were more interrelated.

**Github dataset**- the github social network consists of the developers using and not using the machine learning algorithms. 
we can further interpret what developers are working only in machine learning an who are working on other topics as well. Apart from that we can see that 
even the developers only using ml codes and those not using ml codes at all are following each other indicating the increase in ML usage such that people 
from coding backgroung and even those not from coding background are leaning towards ML.
